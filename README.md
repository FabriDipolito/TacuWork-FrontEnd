# TacuWork Frontend - Fabricio Dipolito

## Getting Started

First, to set up the project you'll need to install the following:

```
 - node 16.0.0 (you can use nvm)
```

First install node, the proyect is for node 16.0.0 so you can install nvm and once you have nvm installed in your computer, clone de repository
and in a terminal throw this commands:

```
 - nvm install 16.0.0
 - nvm use 16.0.0
```

Now that you have node 16.0.0 runing in your computer, install the dependecies and then run the project:

```
 - npm install
 - npx next dev
```

Now you have the Front running in localhost:3000 if the port is not used, in the web app you can delete Users by clicking a User and then pressing the Delete Button 
and those users get deleted from the database too, and you can also create all the Users again that are in the Jsons Folder in the Backend, so if you Deleted a lot of
Users and want to re create them again yo can by pressing the Create Button.
